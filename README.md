## Motivation

Organizing content and favorites is a difficult job, especially when they are markdown files mirrored in random repositories, as I have the habit of searching documents on Github, many of them focused on good practices and usage guides the favorite button and selecting by topics becomes a little harder.

The aim of the project is to centralize these valuable documents and save them to your profile, you can create articles and folders for organization and the project nicely displays the markdown content.
