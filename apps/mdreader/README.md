# :bookmark: MD Reader - Web Application

### :blue_book: Description

MD Reader is a web application built using React, Remix, and Supabase. It incorporates the following technologies:

* **Blurhash** ->  Provides a compact representation of a placeholder for an image.
* **BoringAvatars** ->  Offers an avatar generator playground.
* **React-Hook-Form** -> Simplifies React forms validation.
* **SWR** ->  Provides React Hooks for data fetching.
* **Tailwind** -> Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS.
* **Zod** -> Facilitates schema declaration and validation.

### :exclamation: Purpose:

MD Reader aims to enhance user experience by enabling them to save, organize, and share valuable content from GitHub and knowledge bases. It serves as a convenient repository for links that users may find interesting and wish to share with their team.

I chose Remix for its route system, which is similar to react-router-dom. Leveraging my experience with react-router-dom, I found Remix to be an easier and more streamlined option for transitioning from client-side to server-side rendering.
